IRMA javascript client
======================

Just some temporary notes. While developping, just run

    grunt

it'll automatically watch the source files and dump the compiled outputs into `build/`.

Alternatively, you can call

    grunt build

to make a single build.

## Development tools

You may also need to install some development tools. Run

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install -g bower

to install Grunt. Run

    npm install

to download the desired node packages (I think ;)). Also, when we are using
external js libraries (we're not using jQuery for now on the client side at
least), run

    bower install

first to download these packages.
