IRMA javascript client
======================

Just some temporary notes. While developping, just run

    grunt

it'll automatically watch the source files and dump the compiled outputs into `build/`.

Alternatively, you can call

    grunt build

to make a single build.

## Development tools

You may also need to install some development tools. Run

    npm install -g grunt-cli

to install Grunt. Run

    npm install

to download the desired node packages (I think ;)).
